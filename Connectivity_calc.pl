###This script handles flowcontrol for calculating connectivity for the CPS project.

###It will successively run cost model calculation and attraction model calculation.

###It will handle cost distance estimation from the cost models.

###It will calculate connectivity estimation.  All of this should be handled in a GRASS GIS shell.  The script is being written assuming a Linux environment, but should be able to run in windows without too much trouble provided that it is run from a GRASS shell with a perl compiler.
